## Instructions 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Review this website for more details on using R Markdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. Complete the assignment by inserting your R code wherever you see the string "#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE".

When you click the **Knit** button, a document (PDF, Word, or HTML format) will be generated that includes both the assignment content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks.

Submit **both**  the rmd and generated output files. Failing to submit both files will be subject to mark deduction.

## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(2,4,6,\ldots,20)$.

```{r}
#Insert your code here.
seq(2,20,by = 2)
```


## Question 1

Use the following commands to install the `airquality` dataset and load the `datasets` package into your session.
```{r}
#install.packages("datasets")
library(datasets) 
data(airquality)
str(airquality)
```


a) Use a histogram to assess the normality of the `Ozone` variable, then explain why it does not appear normally distributed.
```{r}
hist(airquality$Ozone)
#The Ozone variable in airquality is heavily left skewed, indicating a non normal distribution.   
```

b) Create a set of boxplots that shows the distribution of `Ozone` in each month. 
Use different colors for each month.
```{r}
boxplot(Ozone~Month, data=airquality, main="Ozone Distrbution", ylab="Ozone Levels", xlab="Month")
```



##Question 2

Use the following commands to install the `marketing` dataset and load the `datarium` package into your session.
```{r}
#install.packages("datarium")
library(datarium)
data("marketing", package = "datarium")
str(marketing)
```

a)  Find the covariance between the `Sales` and the advertising budget of `newspaper`. Comment on the output, in terms of the strength and direction of the relationship.
```{r}
cov(marketing$sales, marketing$newspaper)
#The covariance between sales and the advertising budget of newspaper is about 37. 
#Indicating a positive linear relationship between both variables. 
```

b) Plot the `Sales` as a function of the `Youtube` variable using a scatterplot, then graph the least-square line on the same plot. 
Hint: You may use the `ggplot()` function from `ggplot2` package. 

```{r}
plot(marketing$sales, marketing$youtube)
abline(lm(youtube~sales, data=marketing))
```

c) Use the regression line to predict the `Sales` amount when `newspaper` budget is `$136.80K`. Comment on the difference between the output and the expected value. 
```{r}
rlmodel <- lm(sales~newspaper, data = marketing)
temp.df <- data.frame(newspaper = (136.80))
predict(rlmodel, temp.df)
abs(predict(rlmodel, temp.df) - marketing$sales[which(marketing$newspaper == 136.80)])
#The difference for the predicted value minus the actual value for sales is 7.3
#This is significantly different indicating a outlier in the actual case based on the model.
```

d) Use `newspaper` and `facebook` variables to build a linear regression model to predict `sales`. Display a summary of your model indicating Residuals, Coefficients, ..., etc. What conclusion can you draw from this summary?
```{r}
model <- lm(sales~newspaper + facebook, data = marketing)
summary(model)
#The summary for the model indicates a couple of things.
#First, the Residuals indicates the distribution.
#Indicating a normal distribution with a right skew and negative outliers.
#Second, is the coefficients; intercept and variables; estimate, standard error, t-value and p-value.
#Indicating a low significance for both variables. 

```

e) Use the regression line to predict the `Sales` amount when `newspaper` budget is `$136.80K` and `facebook` is `$43.92K`.
```{r}
predict(model, newdata = data.frame(facebook = 43.92, newspaper = 136.80))
```

f) What is the difference between the output in (e) and the output in (c)
```{r}
abs(predict(rlmodel, temp.df) - predict(model, newdata = data.frame(facebook = 43.92, newspaper = 136.80)))
```

g) Display the correlation matrix of the variables: `youtube`, `facebook`, `newspaper` and `sales`. What conclusion can you draw?
```{r}
cor(marketing)
#The correlation matrix indicates all positive correlation. 
#A significant correlation of youtube, facebook, and newspaper respectively to sales
#And a surprising correlation between facebook and newspaper 
```

h) In your opinion, which statistical test should be used to discuss the relationship between `youtube` and `sales`?
Hint:  Review the difference between Pearson and Spearman tests.
```{r}
#Pearson statistical test should be used to discuss the relationship between youtube and sales.
```


##Question 3

Install the `carData` dataset on your computer using the command `install.packages("carData")`. Then load the `CanPop: Canadian Population Data` into your session using the following command.  The CanPop` has 16 rows and 2 columns and represent the decennial time-series of Canadian population between 1851 and 2001.
```{r}
#install.packages("carData")
library("carData")
data("CanPop", package = "carData")
str(CanPop)
```

a) Which of the two variables is the independent variable and which is the dependent variable? Explain your choice.
```{r}
#The variable year is the independent variable and population is the dependent variable. 
#This is because year effects population. Making population dependent on year. 
```

b) Assuming that year and population are linearly related, give the equation and the graph of the least-squares regression line.
Hint: use lm() function.
```{r}
slmodel <- lm(population~year, data = CanPop)
slmodel
plot(CanPop$year, CanPop$population, xlab="Year", ylab="Population", main="Year and Population Linearly Related")
abline(slmodel)
```

c) Explain the meaning of the slope and y-intercept for the least-squares regression line in (b).
```{r}
#In question 3. b) we get a slope of 0.18 and y-intercept of -337.09.
#The regression line indicates a slow rise starting in the negative position when the independent variable is 0. 
```

d) In year 2020, what would you predict the population's size to be.  Does the value of the predicted size matches your expectations? Explain.
```{r}
predict(slmodel, newdata = data.frame(year = 2020))
#The predicted value for population in the year 2020 is 29.19.
#This does not match my expectations because it is less then the actual population for the year 2001.
#The results lead me to believe that the model is not linear. 
```
